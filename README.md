# Transcription and Translation Pipeline

Welcome to the **Transcription and Translation Pipeline!** This project integrates state-of-the-art models to deliver seamless transcription, translation, and text-to-speech conversion for multiple languages dynamically.

---

## Features

- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):** Convert audio input into text using OpenAI Whisper.
- **Translation:** Translate text between Indian languages and English with IndicTrans.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Generate audio output from text using Google TTS.
- **Dynamic Language Support:** Automatically detects and adapts to various languages.
- **Model Integration:** Includes integrations with tools like LangFlow for workflow optimization and Datastack for efficient data management.
- **Transformers:** Leverages state-of-the-art transformer models such as BERT for enhanced NLP tasks.

## Components

- **OpenAI Whisper:** Recognizes and transcribes speech into text.
- **IndicTrans:** Handles language translation between supported Indian languages and English.
- **Google TTS:** Converts translated text into audio output.
- **Transformers:** Utilizes powerful transformer-based models like BERT for improved language understanding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher.
- Required packages: `torch`, `transformers`, `google-cloud-texttospeech`.
- Access to APIs for OpenAI Whisper, IndicTrans, and Google TTS.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd transcription-translation-pipeline
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure API keys and environment variables:
   - Add your API keys for Google TTS.
   - Ensure access to OpenAI Whisper and IndicTrans models.

### Running the Pipeline

#### Transcription Mode:
```bash
python pipeline.py --mode transcription --input <audio_file_path>
```

#### Translation Mode:
```bash
python pipeline.py --mode translation --input <audio_file_path> --target_language <language_code>
```

## Dynamic Language Handling

- Whisper detects the input language automatically.
- IndicTrans dynamically translates text based on the desired target language.
- Google TTS generates audio in the target language.
- Workflow optimization and data management are supported through LangFlow and Datastack integrations.
